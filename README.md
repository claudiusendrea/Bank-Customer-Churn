Churn rate analysis project

This is a case study. The data was provided by Kaggle.com. The goal is to showcase my thought process and my proficiency with specific tools used to tackle the business question. My decisions would likely differ, in a real-world scenario, particularly when collaborating with more experienced team members.
This project aims to provide stakeholders with an intuitive, visually appealing interface to easily explore and understand key banking metrics. By incorporating both Tableau and Excel, the project offers flexibility to accommodate diverse user preferences and needs. 

Project scenario

A bank with branches in Spain, France, and Germany seeks an in-depth analysis of their customer churn rate. The objective is to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer attrition across different regions. This analysis will help the bank develop targeted strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn. The project will involve data analysis and the use of data visualization tools to present findings and actionable insights. 
The main questions are:
1.	How is the distribution of churn rate by age, number of products and points earned?
2.	Are there any patterns in churn rate and complaints based on card type and gender?
3.	Are there any differences in the geographical location of the customers?

Process 

The first project step is to clean the data thoroughly using Excel to ensure accuracy and reliability. Next, it will involve exploring and understanding the company's specific requirements and objectives. Following this, a detailed analysis of the customer churn rate will be conducted to identify key trends and factors. Finally, the insights gained will be visualized by creating an interactive dashboard using Tableau to facilitate easy interpretation and decision-making.

Findings:

Customers aged 46-65 show a significantly higher tendency to leave the bank compared to other age groups. Germany exhibits the highest churn rate, exceeding 32%, which is double that of France and Spain. Customers with only 2 products have the lowest churn rate, while those with 3 or 4 products have extremely high churn rates. Customers with very few points tend to leave the bank more frequently. While churn rates do not vary across different card types, customers who have filed complaints are more likely to leave than those who have not. Female customers report higher complaint and churn rates compared to male customers.
